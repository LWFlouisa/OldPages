## What Is Dystopian Magical Realism
Dystopian Magical Realism is a hybrid genre of dystopian science fiction and magical realism, that combines light elements of the fantastic without being explicit ( such as in books like what Haruki Murakmai wrote ), but that are explicitely set in near future dystopian societies.

Such a work can often include authorial autobiographical elements. Some of Gilermo Del Toros movies like Pans Labarinth and THe Shape Of Water come very close to being this, except that this are generally set in historical periods, and not within the next five to ten years.

Frequently technology is only just a step beyond what is currently available, or perpetually stuck in the present from which the work was written, despite being fourty to eighty years in the future.
